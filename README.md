# k-spectral-sets
This code is designed to take in a general square matrix A, and estimate the value of K of the associated K-spectral set.  
Calculations use results that are extensions from "Spectral Sets: Numerical Range and Beyond" by Crouzeix and Greenbaum. 
These new results are not yet published, and they are a collaboration between Natalie Wellen and Anne Greenbaum.
